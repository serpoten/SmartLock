All the scripts needed for the micropython.

I hardly recommend to download mpfshell and acces the micro via the terminal.

Basic commands for the micro in mpfshell:

*open ws:"your ip for the micro"

*put test.py #upload a script

*ls # you see the scripts inside the directory

*rm # remove a script

*get test.py #get a script from the directory

Note:

Try to connect via the mpfshell from your folder where you have the scripts located as the put and get commands then are direct.
